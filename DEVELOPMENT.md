# Development

We maintain several auxiliary scripts to ease workflow.

* `run-slides` compiles the slides selected lectures

* `run-notebook` runs the notebook of selected lectures

* `run-problem` compiles selected problem sets

* `run-update` updates the repository, including its submodules


**JupyterLab extensions**

We use several Jupyterlab extensions during the course. These are all installed in ``configurations/jupyterLab_extensions.py``
