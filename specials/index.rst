We discuss selected topics in more details based on student demands.

===========================
Nonstandard standard errors
===========================

We review issues in the construction of standard errors such as the potential bias of robust standard error estimates, clustering, and serial correlation based on the material presented in `Angrist & Pischke (2009) <https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8769.html>`_. We use this opportunity to discuss the research reported in `Krueger (1999) <https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/114/2/497/1844226>`_.

============================
Structural microeconometrics
============================

We discuss the basic motivation behind structural econometric modeling. We quickly focus on the class of Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models that are often used in labor economics to study human capital accumulation and discuss their economic model, mathematical formulation, and alternative calibration procedures. We explore the seminal work outlined in `Keane & Wolpin (1994) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109768?>`_ as an example.
